# BudgetTracker Pivot

**Vision**

BudgetTracker aims to become an all-in-one personal finance companion. Building on a solid subscription tracking foundation, it will expand to cover every facet of budgeting – from day-to-day expenses to long-term financial goals – while retaining an elegant UI and privacy-first philosophy.

**Planned Module Layout**

```
backend/          Spring Boot microservices (auth, subscriptions, transactions)
ui-react/         React front-end application (SPA) using TypeScript
```  

**Historical Reference**

This project evolved from a subscription tracking application into a comprehensive budget management tool.
